<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, Iâ€™m Naman, a Computer Science and Engineering student at IIIT Sonepat with a strong passion for technology and a forward-thinking mindset. Iâ€™m currently in my second year, actively exploring the world of software development with a focus on C++, Data Structures & Algorithms, and Web Development.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past year, Iâ€™ve built a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving. Iâ€™m also diving into competitive programming to sharpen my logical thinking and coding speed. Alongside academics, Iâ€™m working towards becoming an SDE intern by the end of my third semester through structured learning, hands-on projects, and consistent practice.
</p>
<p>
  When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll likely find me playing BGMI (Pochinki drop ðŸ‘€), following La Liga (Hala Madrid! âš½), or designing engaging slides and presentations. Iâ€™m currently learning Git & GitHub, exploring HTML/CSS/JS, and gradually leveling up in full-stack development with guidance from Angela Yuâ€™s course.
